Overview

Eternal Bhagavad Gita is a devotional/educational app presenting the Bhagavad Gita in Sanskrit with transliteration, translation, meanings, search, audio playback, and a verse-of-the-day feature. We do not require user accounts and we do not collect, sell, or share personal data.

Data We Collect

We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII).
  No account, login, or profile.
  No analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs.
  No location, contacts, camera, or microphone access.

Local app storage

The app may store non-personal preferences (e.g., one-time snackbar “thank you” flag) on your device using local storage (AsyncStorage). This data never leaves your device.

Device Permissions

Network: to load in-app links (e.g., help pages or donation page).
Audio playback: to play chapter verse audio; the app does not record audio.

Payments / Donations

The app may include a Donate button that opens an external payment page (e.g., PayPal). Donations are voluntary and do not unlock digital goods or features in the app. Payment processing is handled by the external provider; we do not receive or store your payment details. Please review their privacy policy when donating.

Third-Party Links

External links (e.g., museums, scriptures, payment provider) are provided for convenience. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of third-party sites.

Children’s Privacy

The app is suitable for a general audience and does not target children specifically. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

Data Retention

We do not collect personal data; therefore we do not retain or delete such data. Locally stored preferences remain on your device until you uninstall the app or clear app data.

Security

Although we do not process personal data, we use reasonable measures to keep the app and its content secure. Any external payment is processed by the payment provider over HTTPS.

Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy to reflect app or legal changes. Updates will be posted at the same URL with a revised Effective date.
